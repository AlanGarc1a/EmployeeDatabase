# EmployeeDatabase

A web application where a user can create, edit, update, and delete an employee from a database. This project
was built to understand how to use MySQL with modern technologies such as React.js.

# Motivation

Creating a full stack application using MySQL as the database and Node.js to communicate with it.

# Installation 

To run the application you will need to:

* Clone the repository locally

```
    https://github.com/AlanGarc1a/EmployeeDatabase.git
```

* Create a ```.env``` file and store all database connection information or any other environment variables that will change

* Install dependencies for both client and server using ```npm install``
